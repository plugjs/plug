Unit Testing for the PlugJS Build System
========================================

This plugin provides both a test runner (somewhat similar to
[Mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha)) and an assertion framework
(heavily inpired by [Chai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai) and
[Jasmine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine)), but supports TypeScript
out of the box (without the need to compile tests).
